# IIT-Kanpur-E-Summit-2023-Web-Scraping-
# Project Description:

# Objective:
The objective of this web scraping project is to collect daily price data for various commodities in different states from August 1 to September 30. This data will provide valuable insights into the price trends of essential commodities in various regions during the specified time frame.

# Project Scope:

# Data Source:
The primary data source for this project will be government or agricultural websites that regularly publish daily price data for commodities, including vegetables, fruits, grains, and other essential items. The specific websites will be identified based on the availability of relevant data.

# Data Categories:
The project will focus on scraping daily price data for a range of commodities, which may include but are not limited to:

Vegetables (e.g., tomatoes, potatoes, onions)
Fruits (e.g., apples, bananas, oranges)
Grains (e.g., rice, wheat, maize)
Pulses (e.g., lentils, chickpeas)
Spices (e.g., turmeric, coriander)
Dairy products (e.g., milk, eggs)

# Geographical Scope:
The project aims to collect data from multiple states or regions within a country, ensuring a diverse representation of the commodities' prices across various areas. The choice of states or regions will depend on the availability of data sources and the project's specific goals.

# Time Frame:
Data will be collected for the period from August 1 to September 30. This time frame is selected to capture seasonal variations in commodity prices and provide relevant insights for decision-makers.

# Key Activities:
The project will involve the following key activities:

Identifying and selecting reliable data sources: This step includes identifying government websites, agricultural departments, or other authoritative sources that regularly update and publish daily price data for commodities.

Web scraping: Automated web scraping scripts will be developed to extract daily price data for the selected commodities from the identified websites. This involves navigating through the web pages, locating data tables, and collecting the required information.

Data cleansing and transformation: The collected data will be cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy. This includes handling missing values, standardizing date formats, and organizing the data into a structured format.

State-wise data collection: Data will be collected for different states or regions, and efforts will be made to ensure data representativeness across diverse geographical areas.

Data storage: The scraped data will be stored in a structured format, such as CSV files or a relational database, for further analysis.

# Data Analysis:
The collected data will provide valuable insights into price trends for various commodities across different states during the specified time frame. Data analysis may include the following:

Price fluctuations and trends
Regional price variations
Seasonal patterns
Price correlations between different commodities
Identification of outliers or anomalies
Project Deliverables:
The project will deliver the following:

Scraped and cleaned daily price data for commodities
Structured datasets for each state or region
Data analysis reports and visualizations
Documentation of the web scraping process
Project Benefits:
This web scraping project will provide data that can be used by various stakeholders, including policymakers, farmers, traders, and researchers, to make informed decisions regarding pricing, supply chain management, and agricultural planning. It will help identify trends and patterns in commodity prices, contributing to better resource allocation and market insights.
# Daily Price Data Web Scraping Project

This Python project is designed to scrape daily price data for various commodities in different states from August 1 to September 30, 2023. The collected data is organized into CSV files for each day and grouped into folders for August and September.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3
- Selenium
- Beautiful Soup 4
- Firefox web browser
- GeckoDriver (for Selenium)

Install the Python packages using `pip` and download the [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) for your operating system.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `August_CSV/`: Folder to store CSV files for August
- `September_CSV/`: Folder to store CSV files for September
- `error.log`: Log file for recording errors during web scraping
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python package dependencies
- `data.py`: Main Python code for web scraping

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/Derik714/IIT-Kanpur-E-Summit-2023-Web-Scraping-.git```

2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`. The Packages are mentioned in requirements.txt"

3. Download and configure GeckoDriver for Selenium. Update the Firefox driver path in the `data.py` script if necessary.

4. Run the web scraping code:

5. The code will scrape daily price data for commodities from August 1 to September 30, saving the results in the `August_CSV` and `September_CSV` folders.

## Output

The scraped data is saved in CSV files. The final combined dataset is stored in `retail_prices_data_aug_to_sep.csv`.
